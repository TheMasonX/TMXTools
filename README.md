# TMXTools
Standard C# and WPF tools and utilities. Free use under the MIT license and open to contributions.

Two main components: a standard class library and a WPF library.
- TMXTools is designed to be a lightweight and flexible library that can be used in various applications. It's cross-platform.
- TMXTools.WPF provides a set of controls and utilities for WPF applications. Restricted to Windows due to the WPF dependency.

These are two separate nuget packages for the purposes of minimizing dependencies if WPF is not needed.
